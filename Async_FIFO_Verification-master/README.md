# Async FIFO Verification

This repository presents a verification test case for an asynchronous FIFO based on Systemverilog Object Oriented concepts and also UVM. The general architecture and implementation of the code has been taken from the UVM primer (Ray Salemi):

However the presented verification code in this test case is manipulated to be fitted for the special use case of an asynchronous FIFO.

The RTL source code for the asynchronous FIFO is taken from (Jason Yu):
