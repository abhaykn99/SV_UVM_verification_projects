This folder presents the RTL implementation of an asynchronous FIFO in Systemverilog and VHDL. The Systemverilog RTL source code for the asynchronous FIFO is take from (Jason Yu):

http://www.verilogpro.com/asynchronous-fifo-design/

It should be noted that the Systemverilog code has been modified in several places to be consistent with the proposed verification system. The VHDL source code presents a migration of the Systemverilog code into VHDL. Both RTL designs can be used as test cases for the verification.
